== Sunfounder Sensor Kit V2
Examples in this section are equivalent of what _Sunfounder_ have done
with their _C_ and _Python_ based sample code.

[NOTE]
====
We don't go into details what these samples do as we simply consentrate how
same functionality is accomplished with _Spring Cloud IoT_. For
details about schematics and generic functionality, see their own
documentation.
