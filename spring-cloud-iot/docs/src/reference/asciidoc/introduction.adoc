= Introduction
Spring Cloud IoT(SCIOT) is a framework for application developers to use
Spring concepts with IoT applications. SCIOT aims to provide the
following features:

* Device and Component abstraction.
* Easy configuration model.
* Support for different communication protocols.

== Background

[quote, Wikipedia]
____________________________________________________________________
The *Internet of things (IoT)* is the inter-networking of physical
devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart
devices"), buildings, and other itemsâ€”embedded with electronics,
software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable
these objects to collect and exchange data.
____________________________________________________________________

That said, number of connected devices are expected to dramatically
increase in coming years and to have a sensible ways to program and
interact with these devices from a Java world is becoming more
important.

== Usage Scenarios
There are two major areas where _SCIOT_ is relatively good pick to
build your integrations with existing hardware. Firstly you are
interested to collect metrics from a sensors and send those somewhere
for further processing. Secondly you just want to build a device
having different components and do interaction with those components.
